      <h2>Metario</h2>
      <p>
        I joined a competition with classmates for the 
        <a href="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/">NASA International Apps Challenge</a> 
        hackathon, where I served as the sole programmer. Although our team didn't place, 
        I learned a valuable lesson about presenting our work to the judges in person. 
        Since then, I've decided to make this project open source for everyone to use.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical Details</h3>
      <p>
        Metario is written in Rust 🦀 and uses fundamental physics functions to calculate 
        meteor impact information. I derived these functions from scientific data provided 
        by my teammates. The application simulates meteor trajectories using a 2D model 
        created with the egui library. (I initially attempted a 3D animation using the 
        kiss3d library, but encountered technical issues and lacked time to complete it.) 
        The simulator can compare results with historical events such as the Hiroshima bombing.
      </p>

      <h4>Libraries Used:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Egui</li>
        <li>Color32</li>
        <li>std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved my ability to read and interpret scientific data more effectively</li>
        <li>Developed proficiency with egui, including color management and UI design</li>
        <li>Enhanced my Rust programming skills</li>
        <li>Gained practical experience with physics simulations and calculations</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        The primary goal is to implement a 3D simulation to replace the current 2D model. 
        Additionally, I plan to verify the physics calculations and review the scientific 
        functions for accuracy.
